- 👋 I'm Pallav currently pursuing B.Tech in IT.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and the good old Data Structures.
- 📫 How to reach me? @pallavmid on discord.
- I'm currently working on a startup i.e https://www.hermeias.org/ 
- I code 10 days then commit everything on the 10th day after testing and all the good stuff so my github commit calendar looks trash.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can cook.
